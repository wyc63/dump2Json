# Welcome to the Story Tracker!

Story Tracker is a C++ program for the ECS 36B class at UC Davis. It models the movement of people and things based on a given narrative. It represents the events in the story by generating JSON records of the locations, times, people, and things involved.

# Prerequisites
To build and run the program, you will need:
A C++11 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
The JsonCpp library for handling JSON data

# Procedure
Open the terminal in the device and access to the location of this specific folder.
First, input "make" command into the terminal. The 'main' file will automatically be created.
Type "./main" to run this program. The program will generate 4 records to each individual location and corresponded time. And those 4 records will be saved in Json.
Type "make clean" to clean the file.
